# Backpacker

People travel and experience a lot, and they take pictures to save their memory for long time. Later, when they look at the picture again, some of them may want to remember when and where the pictures are took. 


A description of the application

Our application enables user to visualize their photos on the world map. If user takes a photo through our map, it identifies the location in terms of latitude and longitude coordinate by using GPS, and updates the photo at the coordinate, with the date when it was took. By enlarging or scaling down the map, photos make a group or split apart according to the distance. If a user clicks the group, a list of photo appears and he or she can write a comment to each photo. Each User has to login with E-mail as an ID, and has user number.
